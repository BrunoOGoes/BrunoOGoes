### Hello world! 👋 I'm Bruno 

I am a theoretical physicist specialized in quantum information, with a keen interest in photonic quantum technologies and quantum thermodynamics. After years in academia, I shifted my interest to data science, driven by my multidisciplinary profile and deep appreciation for mathematical models that uncover patterns in data, enabling exploration of the physical world, society, and beyond. I wish to take advantage of my advanced mathematical and programming skills to propose models for business success, derive insights, and develop effective data solutions.

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, research work, and contributions spanning the fields of physics and data science.
